                <h2>Sourdough Bread</h2>
                <p>I have tried countless of times to make sourdough bread from scratch, and although I have my fair share of successes and failures, I absolutely love it.  The kneading of the dough.  The smell that comes from the oven when it's almost ready.  The rustic-brown crust that envelopes the entire loaf.  All of these experiences embody what I love when it comes to baking sourdough bread.
                    <br><br>If you are down to make an incredibly tasty treat right after you get home from work, you're in the right place!</p>

                <h2>My Sourdough Bread Story</h2>
                    <p>I am in no position to call myself a professional when it comes to baking, but I love to eat.  When it comes to eating, there's a reason why my wife calls me her “personal trash can”.  In the realm of eating, I like to try all sorts of things, always keeping an open-mind on what's out there.
                    <br ><br >
                    Enter Sourdough bread.
                    <br ><br >
                    I tried sourdough bread for the first time when I was in high school.  The aroma that I smelled once I entered the bakery, the crispy golden brown color on the surface of each loaf, and the crunch once I took a bite left a lasting impression on me.  Years later, I have regained an interest in eating it, but also in the methods on how to make it.  After watching a few YouTube channels like Brothers Green Eats or Alex the French Cooking Guy, I wanted to try my luck and create my own recipe.

                <h2>From Scratch</h2>
                <p>The entire process, minus grounding flour for the mixture has been done from scratch (...maybe someday I'll buy a grain mill!).  The wild yeast that I use, is made from scratch.  It took a week to start the sourdough starter, and I've been keeping it alive since March of 2017.</p>

                <h2>Recording Data</h2>
                <p>I have a booklet that tracks the progress I have made, including what ingredients were used, steps that were taken, and the results of each loaf that were made.  Every sourdough recipe I've made has been different, meaning there has never been a recipe that I've used more than once.  However, the last batches that were made had overall good crusts and crumbs, and thankfully non-gummy bottoms!</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="starter">
                <h2>The Starter</h2>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that I made a starter from scratch.  There are two sources that I paid a lot of attention to in order to create my own starter.  This included a YouTube video from Chef John’s Food Wishes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FkGX3xGlog) as well as this informative recipe (https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-your-own-sourdough-starter-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-47337) by Emma Christensen.  I figured out what measurements I needed that worked best in the temperature of my apartment (yes, this matters), and thankfully I didn’t need to use a scale.  I’m sure a lot of people will give me flack for not using one, but if I can make a decent loaf of bread without it, I’m not complaining.</p>

                <h2>No Dutch Oven, Just a Skillet</h2>
                <p>I would also like to mention that I did not use a dutch oven while baking my bread.  Instead, I used a water bath that I would put in at the same time with the dough, taking it out the bath midway through the baking process.  For any sourdough recipe, it needs steam to help the bread rise during the baking process, otherwise it’ll end up flat-looking for the final result.  The surface I used to cook my loaf is on a cast-iron skillet, and combined with the water bath I was able to obtain the same result of an insulated steam chamber as a dutch oven.  Any metal baking tin will work as a water bath (as long as it can withstand anything above 500 degrees Fahrenheit), and I ended up using my wife’s metal loaf tin.  For my recipe, I’d recommend placing the water bath directly below the skillet for the initial baking, and removing it around 20 minutes into the oven baking process.  I’ll go into more detail in the recipe below.</p>

                <h2>Autolyse</h2>
                <p>Part of the bread making process requires a step called an autolyse, where the dough is left untouched for 20 minutes to an hour after the initial ingredients are mixed together.  The practical reason for doing this is so that the dough is easier to handle when kneading.  There are other scientific reasons why this step is so crucial, however I’d rather have someone else explain it, so here’s a link (https://www.bakerybits.co.uk/resources/autolyse-what-why-how/) for an explanation.</p>

                <h2>Making the wild yeast</h2>
                <p>There are many ways out there on the internet that explains the best way to make wild yeast, however I’ve broken it down to a few easy steps (that worked for me anyway).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Boil a glass jar in a pot of water for 5-10 minutes and remove it onto a tea towel, making sure it’s dry.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Once cool, add 1 Cup of all purpose flour into the jar, and add a little less than ½ a cup of water as well, stirring thoroughly.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Once mixed, put a lid on top of the jar, having a partial opening (just a crack) to let some air to get inside.  This always the airborne yeast (don’t be alarmed, its everywhere!) to get in and start feeding on the mixture.</p></li>
                    <li><p>You’re going to leave this mixture alone for the rest of the day, so mark it with a dry erase pen or write it down somewhere on what time you mixed the dough.</p></li>
                    <li><p>On the next day at around the same time you initially mixed the dough, remove half of the mixture (I pour mine down the sink drain), and add 1/2 cup of flour and 1/3 a cup of water to the mixture in the jar, mixing it thoroughly.  Mark somewhere on the outside of the jar the level of where the mixture is, the time of day you mixed it, and leave it alone for another day.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Repeat step 5, for a week.  You heard me right.  You’ll keep doing this so that the yeast is allowed to develop, creating a slightly bubbly mixture, that you’ll eventually use for the sourdough bread recipe.</p></li>
                    <li><p>If your mixture grows in size after a few hours of feeding, it’ll eventually deflate if you leave it alone for another several hours.  If you start to see this process, you’re doing everything right!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Name your yeast!  You basically grown a living organism, so you might as well make it part of the family! (Not like that’s weird or anything...)</p></li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Making the sourdough</h2>
                <p>After your successful attempt to make wild yeast, it’s onto making the actual sourdough.  Good luck!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>The wild yeast you’ll use must grow in size before use, otherwise the end product will look flat in size as well.  Typically I make the dough 8 hours after I feed my wild yeast mixture.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Grab a large mixing bowl and pour in the 3 cups of water and 7 tablespoons of the wild yeast.  Mix together until the yeast dissolves into the water. Should look milky.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Add the 3 cups of All Purpose flour and the 2 ¼ cups of Whole Wheat flour into the mixing bowl, either using your hands or a dough scraper until the mixture is almost completely mixed in.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Autolyse! Set aside the dough mixture, covering it with a tea towel for about 20 minutes to an hour.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Add the 2 ½ tablespoons of salt into the mixture, and fold the dough onto itself, grabbing one end of the dough and folding it towards the other end.  Keep doing this for 5-10 minutes or so.  Afterwards let it set for 5 minutes, covering it again with a tea towel.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Remove dough from mixing bowl onto a clean counter top.  Having a dough scraper is really useful for getting all of the dough out of the mixing bowl, otherwise, a wooden ladle could work as well.  It’s a sticky mess regardless!</p></li>
                    <li><p>The next step is a little tricky, you’re going to stretch out the dough lengthwise, and fold one end of the dough towards the center, folding the other end right on top.</p></li>
                    <li><p></p></li>
